**Flipkart Health+: A Foray into India’s Digital Healthcare Landscape (and its Evolution)**
**Flipkart Health+**, initially known as **SastaSundar Healthbuddy Limited**, represented a significant
strategic foray by Flipkart into the burgeoning digital healthcare, online pharmacy, diagnostics, and
e-consultation sectors in India. This move underscored Flipkart’s ambition to diversify its offerings beyond
traditional e-commerce and tap into the high-growth, yet complex, healthcare market. The original entity,
SastaSundar Healthbuddy, was co-founded in **2013** by **Banwari Lal Mittal and Ravi Kant Sharma**
in Kolkata, West Bengal. It began its journey as an online pharmacy, aiming to provide accessible and
affordable healthcare products and services. SastaSundar Healthbuddy Limited itself was a subsidiary of
SastaSundar Ventures Limited, established in 2014, and had built a network of **over 200 physical
stores** across India, supporting its online operations through a "Healthbuddy" network for counseling
and service centers.
**Acquisition and Rebranding: Becoming a Walmart-Owned Entity**
The strategic shift for SastaSundar occurred in **November 2021**, when Flipkart Health acquired a
majority stake in **Sastasundar Marketplace Ltd**, the entity that owned and operated SastaSundar.com.
While the exact sum of the acquisition was undisclosed, media reports at the time suggested an
enterprise valuation of approximately **1,150 crore**. This acquisition was completed by **April 1, 2022**,
officially making Flipkart Health+ a **Walmart-owned company** and integrating it into the broader
Flipkart Group ecosystem. The intent behind this acquisition was clear: to leverage Flipkart’s vast
pan-India reach, robust technology infrastructure, and extensive last-mile supply chain capabilities with
SastaSundar’s deep expertise and established network in the healthcare sector. This was expected to
create a formidable player in the competitive online pharmacy space.
Following the acquisition, Flipkart Health+ officially launched its dedicated app, designed with a
user-friendly interface to facilitate easy access to genuine medicines and healthcare products and
services across **20,000 PIN codes** in India. The platform aimed to connect millions of customers with
independent sellers and licensed pharmacists for prescription validation and accurate medicine
dispensation. On **March 15, 2022**, Flipkart Health+ appointed **Prashant Jhaveri** as its Chief
Executive Officer (CEO), a seasoned industry veteran with prior experience from Apollo Health and
Lifestyle Limited and MediBuddy, signaling Flipkart’s serious intent to grow this new vertical. The initial
vision included onboarding third-party healthcare service providers to offer value-added services such as
teleconsultation and e-diagnostics.
**Early Funding for SastaSundar**
Prior to the Flipkart acquisition, SastaSundar Healthbuddy had already secured notable funding rounds
that validated its early business model:
* In **May 2017**, it received **33.4 crore (approximately $5 million)** in funding from the Japan-based
pharmaceutical company **Rohto Pharmaceutical**.
* In **August 2019**, **Mitsubishi Corporation**, a major Japanese trading and investment firm, further
invested **100 crore (approximately $14.1 million)** in the company, highlighting international investor
confidence in its potential. These investments contributed to its expansion and technological development
before its integration into the Flipkart ecosystem.
**Challenges, Competitive Landscape, and Reported Downfall**
Despite the significant backing from Flipkart and Walmart, the journey for Flipkart Health+ proved to be
exceptionally challenging in India’s highly competitive and tightly regulated digital healthcare market. This
sector was already populated by strong, established players such as **Tata 1mg, Reliance Retail-owned
Netmeds, PharmEasy, Apollo Pharmacy**, and **Amazon Pharmacy**.
Several critical issues reportedly plagued Flipkart Health+ from its inception as a Flipkart-led entity,
contributing to its difficulties:
* **Inferior Service Quality:** Customers reportedly experienced inconsistent service quality, which could
include delays in order processing, inaccuracies in dispensing, or challenges with customer support.
* **Drug Stocking Issues:** Problems with inventory management and drug availability may have led to
situations where essential medicines were out of stock, frustrating customers and potentially driving them
to competitors.
* **Back-end Bugs:** Technical glitches and back-end issues within the platform could have hampered its
operational efficiency, affecting everything from order placement to delivery tracking and payment
processing. Such bugs can severely impact user experience and trust.
* **Intense Market Competition:** The Indian e-pharmacy market is characterized by aggressi
competition, with players vying for market share through pricing, rapid delivery, and value-added services.
Flipkart Health+ entered a crowded space where established rivals had already built customer loyalty and
robust supply chains. Competitors frequently engaged in price wars and expanded their services, making
it difficult for a new entrant to gain significant traction.
* **Regulatory Complexity:** The online pharmacy sector in India operates under a complex and evolving
regulatory framework, requiring strict adherence to drug dispensing laws, data privacy, and other
healthcare regulations. Navigating this landscape effectively can be a significant hurdle.
**Reported Defunct Status (as of July 2025)**
As of the current period in **July 2025**, the **Flipkart Health+ project appears to be largely defunct** in
its original form. Multiple indicators point to its withdrawal from active operations:
* **Website Inactivity:** The official Flipkart Health+ website (‘https://healthplus.flipkart.com/‘) is reportedly
no longer working or redirecting as expected, signaling a cessation of active online services.
* **App Withdrawal:** The Flipkart Health+ App has been withdrawn from the Google Play Store,
preventing new downloads and potentially limiting functionality for existing users.
* **Lack of Integration with Flipkart Website:** The main Flipkart website no longer prominently features
links or direct access to healthcare services under the "Health+" brand, suggesting a de-prioritization or
complete withdrawal of the vertical from Flipkart’s core offerings.
* **Leadership Change:** Prashant Jhaveri, who was appointed CEO in March 2022, reportedly left the
company within less than a year in **July 2023**, with an internal candidate, Kanchan Mishra, taking over
as Chief Business Officer for a period. This leadership churn, particularly the departure of the CEO, often
correlates with strategic re-evaluations.
* **SastaSundar Reclaims IPR:** Significantly, in **January 2025**, media reports indicated that the
original founders of SastaSundar, through SastaSundar Ventures Ltd, had **reclaimed the brand’s
intellectual property rights (IPRs)** from Flipkart Health+. The chairman of SastaSundar Group, B.L.
Mittal, stated that "The deal with Flipkart is over," and that SastaSundar would launch its own app again.
This move strongly confirms the disengagement of Flipkart from the SastaSundar-based healthcare
business. Mittal also suggested that Flipkart’s decision might align with a broader "global plan to exit the
health business" by Walmart.
The reported closure of Flipkart Health+ underscores the immense challenges of breaking into and
sustaining operations within India’s highly competitive online healthcare market, even for a well-funded
entity backed by giants like Flipkart and Walmart. The venture likely faced formidable competition from
existing players who had deeper roots, specialized expertise, and a more focused approach to the
nuances of healthcare delivery, ultimately leading to its reported strategic re-evaluation and cessation of
operations.
